# Transliteration Keyboard

## About

A keyboard bundle for Mac built using [Ukelele by SIL](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) that has mappings for transliterations common to Semitic studies

## Install

Assuming you've never done this before:

- At the top of the page, click on the green button that says `Code` and then select `Download ZIP`.
- In your Downloads folder (or where ever your files are downloded), unzip the file
- From the newly created folder, move `Transliteration.bundle` to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`
  - If you are unsure how to do that, in Finder open a new tab and then go to `Go > Go to Folder...` and copy and paste `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` 
  - Then just drag and drop the file into that location
- Next, open System Preferences > Keyboard > Input Sources and click on the `+` symbol
- Find the keyboard called `Transliteration` under English keyboards

## Mappings

- The parenthesis indicate the combination for a dead key
- ⌥ = alt/option
- These are not all the mappings, but some unique to this board and common to Semitic studies
